# Hello World

This is the first MDX-powered post on Ntlaks.dev. It keeps writing inside the project while adding richer blog rendering.

<Callout type="info">
  MDX lets you write in Markdown and render React components inline without leaving your codebase.
</Callout>

```js
const greeting = "Hello from MDX";

function announce(message) {
  console.log(`[blog] ${message}`);
}

announce(greeting);
```

You can mix text, code blocks, and custom UI components in one post while keeping everything versioned in Git.
